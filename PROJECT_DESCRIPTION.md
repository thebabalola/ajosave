# Ajosave - Project Description

## One-Line Description

**Ajosave** is a decentralized community savings platform that brings traditional Ajo/Esusu rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs) on-chain with blockchain transparency and automation.

## Short Description

Ajosave digitizes traditional community savings practices using blockchain technology. Built for African communities and accessible globally, it enables trustless, transparent, and automated savings group management through smart contracts on Celo and Base networks.

## Key Features

- **Three Pool Types**: Rotational savings (traditional Ajo/Esusu), target-based savings, and flexible deposits/withdrawals
- **Smart Contract Escrow**: Funds locked in audited, transparent contracts with no custodial risks
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Deployed on Celo (mobile-friendly) and Base (low-cost L2)
- **Automated Enforcement**: Rules, penalties, and payouts execute automatically
- **Modern Web Interface**: Responsive design with wallet integration and real-time tracking
- **Yield Integration**: Optional DeFi yield generation for idle funds

## Problem Statement

Traditional savings groups (Ajo, Esusu, Tontine) face challenges:
- Trust issues between members
- Manual record-keeping and errors
- Geographic limitations
- Lack of transparency
- No automated enforcement of rules
- Risk of fund mismanagement

## Solution

Ajosave solves these problems by:
- **Blockchain Transparency**: All transactions are visible on-chain
- **Smart Contract Automation**: Rules enforced automatically by code
- **Global Accessibility**: Anyone with internet and a wallet can participate
- **Non-Custodial**: Users always control their funds
- **Transparent Tracking**: Real-time dashboard and activity feeds
- **Multi-Chain**: Accessible on affordable, fast networks

## Technical Highlights

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity 0.8.30 with OpenZeppelin libraries
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Web3**: Wagmi + Viem for Ethereum interactions
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for off-chain data
- **Networks**: Celo Sepolia & Base Sepolia (testnets deployed)
- **Verified Contracts**: All contracts verified on Sourcify

## Target Audience

- African communities looking to digitize savings groups
- Global users interested in transparent, trustless savings
- DeFi users seeking alternative savings mechanisms
- Communities wanting automated financial management

## Use Cases

1. **Family Savings Groups**: Extended families saving together for events
2. **Community Cooperatives**: Neighborhood savings and credit associations
3. **Business Savings**: Small businesses pooling resources
4. **Goal-Based Savings**: Groups saving for specific purposes (weddings, education)
5. **Investment Clubs**: Rotating investment opportunities

## Deployment Status

✅ **Celo Sepolia Testnet** - Deployed and verified
✅ **Base Sepolia Testnet** - Deployed and verified
🔜 **Mainnet Deployment** - Coming soon

## Technology Stack

**Blockchain**: Solidity, Foundry, OpenZeppelin  
**Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
**Web3**: Wagmi, Viem, Reown AppKit  
**Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)  
**Networks**: Celo, Base  

## Unique Value Propositions

1. **First On-Chain ROSCA Platform**: Bringing traditional savings practices to blockchain
2. **Mobile-First Network**: Celo enables smartphone accessibility
3. **Multiple Pool Types**: Flexible options for different savings needs
4. **Automated & Transparent**: No manual record-keeping or trust required
5. **Open Source**: Fully auditable and transparent codebase

## Impact Goals
